F   Dm  F  Dm  Am  Dm  Am G  C
C             Dm
I follow the Moskva
     F         C
Down to Gorky Park
                  Dm     Am  G
Listening to the wind of change
C                  Dm
An August summer night
Bb              C
Soldiers passing by
Dm                    Am   G        F   Dm  F  Dm  Am  Dm  Am G C
Listening to the wind of change

The world closing in
Did you ever think
That we could be so close,like brothers
The future's in the air
I can feel it everywhere
Blowing with the wind of change

Chorus:
C    G           Dm           G
Take me to the magic of the moment
   C         G
On a glory night
     Dm                 G           Am
Where the children of tomorrow dream away
F                 G
In the wind of change


Walking down the street
Distant memories
Are buried in the past forever

C             Dm
I follow the Moskva
     F         C
Down to Gorky Park
                  Dm     Am  G
Listening to the wind of change

Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow share their dreams
With you and me

C    G           Dm           G
Take me to the magic of the moment
   C         G
On a glory night
     Dm                 G           Am
Where the children of tomorrow dream away
F                 G
In the wind of change

Am                           G
The wind of change blows straight
          Em  G   Am
Into the face of time
                     Em    G
Like a stormwind that will ring
                         D     C
The freedom bell for peace of mind
                  Dm
Let your balalaika sing
                     E
What my guitar wants to say

Solo

Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow share their dreams
With you and me

Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow dream away
In the wind of change
