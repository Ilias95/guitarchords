F   Dm  F  Dm  Am  Dm  Am G  C
C             Dm
I follow the Moskva
     F         C
Down to Gorky Park
                  Dm     Am  G
Listening to the wind of change
C                  Dm
An August summer night
Bb              C
Soldiers passing by
Dm                    Am   G        F   Dm  F  Dm  Am  Dm  Am G C
Listening to the wind of change

The world closing in
Did you ever think
That we could be so close,like brothers
The future's in the air
I can feel it everywhere
Blowing with the wind of change

Chorus:
C    G           Dm           G
Take me to the magic of the moment
   C         G
On a glory night
     Dm                 G           Am
Where the children of tomorrow dream away
F                 G
In the wind of change


Walking down the street
Distant memories
Are buried in the past forever

C             Dm
I follow the Moskva
     F         C
Down to Gorky Park
                  Dm     Am  G
Listening to the wind of change

Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow share their dreams
With you and me

C    G           Dm           G
Take me to the magic of the moment
   C         G
On a glory night
     Dm                 G           Am
Where the children of tomorrow dream away
F                 G
In the wind of change

Am                           G
The wind of change blows straight
          Em  G   Am
Into the face of time
                     Em    G
Like a stormwind that will ring
                         D     C
The freedom bell for peace of mind
                  Dm
Let your balalaika sing
                     E
What my guitar wants to say

Solo

Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow share their dreams
With you and me

Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow dream away
In the wind of change

C                         D
So, so you think you can tell,
             Am                   G
Heaven from Hell, blue skies from pain.
                     D                       C
Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail,
               Am
A smile from a veil
                      G
Do you think you can tell?

                          C                   D
And did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts,
                Am                    G
Hot ashes for trees, hot air for a cool breeze,
                     D                    C
Cold comfort for change and did you exchange
                      Am                         G
A walk on part in the war for a lead role in a cage?


Em  G  Em  G  Em  A  Em  A  G

C                               D
How I wish, how I wish you were here.
           Am                                     G                  D
We're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl, year after year,
                                  C
Running over the same old ground. What have we found?
             Am                         G
The same old fears. Wish you were here!

D7

     Gmaj7
As I reach for a peach

                                          Gm6
Slide a line down behind a sofa in Saz Tropez

Gmaj7
Breaking a stick with a brick on the sand

                                      Gm6
Riding a wave in the wake of an old sedan

G7
Sleeping alone in the drone of the darkness

A7
Scratched by the sand that fell from my love

C7
Deep in my dreams and I still hear her calling

D
If you're alone, I'll come home


Gmaj7
Backward and homebound, the pigeon, the dove

Gm6
Gone with the wind and the rain on an airplane

Gmaj7
Born in a home with no silver spoon

    Gm6
I'm drinking champagne like a good tycoon

G7
Sooner than wait for a break in the weather

     A7
I'll gather my far flung thoughts together

C7
Speeding away on a wind to a new day

D
If you're alone, I'll come home


               Gmaj7
And I'll pause for a while by a country stile

                               Gm6
And listen to the things they say

Gmaj7
Digging for gold in a hole in my hand

                                               Gm6
Open the book, take a look at the way things stand

           G7
And you're leading me down to the place by the sea

A7
I hear you soft voice calling to me

C7
Making a date for later by phone

    D
And if you're alone, I'll come home


Gmaj7  Gm6

We fought him hard we fought him well
Out on the plains we gave him hell
But many came too much for cree
Oh will we ever be set free?

Run to the hills run for your lives

Run to the hills run for your lives

VERSE:
Soldier blue on the barren wastes
Hunting and killing their game
Raping the women and wasting the men
The only good indians are tame
Selling them whisky and taking their gold
Enslaving the young and destroying the old

Run to the hills run for your lives

I take a look through the bars at the last sights,
A D                                         B  E  B  C
Of a world that has gone very wrong for me.
Em
Can it be that there's some sort of error.
G C
Hard to stop the surmounting terror.
A D                                        B E B C
Is it really the end, not some crazy dream?

Em
Somebody please tell me that I'm dreaming,
C
It's not so easy to stop from screaming,
D                                       B E B C
But words escape me when i try to speak.
Em
Tears flow but why am I crying,
C
After all I'm not afraid of dying.
D                                          B E B C
Don't I believe that there never is an end.

Em
As the guards march me out to the courtyard,
C
Somebody cries from a cell "God be with you".
D                                          B E B C
If there's a God then why has he let me go?

Em
As I walk all my life drifts before me,
C
Though the end is near I'm still not sorry.
D                                       B E B C
Catch my soul, it's willing to fly away.

Em
Mark my words believe my soul lives on.
C
Don't worry now that I have gone.
D
I've gone beyond to see the truth.

Em
When you know that your time is close at hand.
C
Maybe then you'll begin to understand,
D                                        B E B C  Em  Bm  C
Life down here is just a strangeillusion

B  Em  A  D  G  C  A  D
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah... Hallowed Be Thy Name

There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold
Fmaj7                         Am/B  Am
And she's buying a stairway to heaven.
Fmaj7     Am           Bmaj7/G#        C/G            D/F#
When she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed
Fmaj7                           Am/B   Am
With a word she can get what she came for.
C  D   Fmaj7        C        G          Dsus4  D
Ooh, ooh, and she's buying a stairway to heaven.

There's a sign on the wall but she wants to be sure
Am          C              D             Fmaj7
'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings.

In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings,

Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven.

There's a feeling I get when I look to the west,
Am       C       G/B      Fmaj7#11  Am
And my spirit is crying for leaving.
Am     C     G/B                   Asus2    Am
In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees,

And it's whispered that soon if we all call the tune
D         C         G/B    Fmaj7#11
Then the piper will lead us to reason.
D         C             G/B      Asus2 Am
And a new day will dawn for those who stand long
D         C         G/B    Fmaj7#11
And the forests will echo with laughter.

If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now,

It's just a spring clean for the May queen.

Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run
C             G/B               Fmaj7      Am
There's still time to change the road you're on.

Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow, and did you know

She's got a smile that it seems to me
Cadd9
Reminds me of childhood memories
       G                                         D
Where everything was as fresh as a bright blue sky

Now and then when i see her face

She takes me away to that special place
           G                                        D
And if i stay too long I'd probably break down and cry

Oooooh Sweet Child of Mine
A    C                  D

She's got eyes of the bluest sky
Cadd9
And if they thought of rain
G                                     D
I'd hate to look into those eyes and see an ounce of pain

Her hair reminds me of a warm safe place
      Cadd9
Where as a child i'd hide
     G                                      D
And prey for the thunder and the rain to quietly pass me by
